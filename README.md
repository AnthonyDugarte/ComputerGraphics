# Computer Graphics

Computer Graphics is an optional course of the Computer Science Department in the School of
Systems Engineering at Universidad de Los Andes, Venezuela.

In this course we covered an introduction to 3D graphics with C++ and modern OpenGL by using
the OpenGL Extension Wrangler library (GLEW) and GLFW to handle windows and user inputs.
